  born: 'February 14, 2002',
  birthplace: 'Philippines',
  nationality: 'Filipino',
  nickname: 'JEDNAZ',

  occupation: 'Fullstack Developer, CEO',

  summary: `Jednaz Lonestamp, publicly known as JEDNAZ, is a Filipino fullstack developer, cybersecurity engineer, and entrepreneur. Born in 2002, he began programming at age 16, developing an early obsession with JavaScript and web architecture that would define his career trajectory.

By 2020, he had adopted Vue.js and TypeScript as his primary tools, developing a philosophy of clean, security-first, performance-driven engineering. He enrolled in a BS Cybersecurity program in 2021, formalizing his knowledge of network security, threat modeling, and secure application design.

In 2022, he self-funded and launched BlackVideo, a full-stack video streaming platform built entirely solo. The project demonstrated his capacity to engineer complex systems end-to-end — from backend infrastructure to responsive UI — without a team or investors.

In 2023, he founded BlackBlazent, a software company operating under his founding principle: "Security is foundational, not optional." The company serves as the umbrella for his ongoing products and engineering services.`,
  earlyLife: `Growing up in the Philippines, Jednaz was drawn to computers early. With limited access to formal resources, he relied on documentation, open-source communities, and sheer determination. His first encounter with HTML at 16 was not a casual curiosity — it was recognition. He knew immediately that code was his medium.

By 17, he was writing vanilla JavaScript projects, studying algorithms, and experimenting with Node.js backends. He taught himself through YouTube tutorials, developer blogs, and reverse-engineering open-source projects. This self-driven methodology would remain a constant throughout his career.`,
  career: `His professional journey accelerated in 2020 with the adoption of Vue.js and TypeScript. He developed a preference for structured, type-safe codebases and clean architecture principles. His work philosophy — influenced by the UNIX ethos and modern security practices — prioritized maintainability, reliability, and security above all.

BlackVideo (2022) became his proof-of-concept at scale: a real product, real users, real engineering challenges solved. The experience of shipping and maintaining a production system accelerated his growth faster than any course or bootcamp could.

The founding of BlackBlazent in 2023 marked his transition from engineer to builder-founder — a role that combines technical execution with strategic vision.`,
